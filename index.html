        Malaysia is not real.It is a hoax,made for us to believe that Britain used it as a trading site.In
        reality,Malaysia
        was bombed and was never to be seen again.It's a coverup for one of the greatest mass murders in history, made
        by
        one of the most prominent empires.

        Malaysia does not exist.All things you call "proof" are actually well fabricated lies and documents made by the
        leading governments of the world.Your Malaysian friends?They're all actors and computer generated personas, part
        of
        the plot to trick the world.

        If you think you've been to Malaysia you are terribly wrong.The plane pilots are all in on this, and have in all
        actuality only flown you to islands close nearby-or in some cases,parts of India, where they have cleared space
        and
        hired actors to act out as real Malaysians.

    Malaysia is not real. It's a codeword for the cold blooded murder, and it is not okay.We will not, accept this.
    Stand up for the ones who died. Let it be known, that malaysia does not exist.#malaysiaisnotreal
